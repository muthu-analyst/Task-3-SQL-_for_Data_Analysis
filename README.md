# Customer Shopping SQL Data Analysis

This project demonstrates how to model, populate, and analyze a basic shopping/order database using SQL.

---

## What I Did

- Created a structured database with three tables: Customers, Products, and Orders.
- Added sample data for customers, products, and their orders to simulate real transactions.
- Wrote several SQL queries to answer key business questions about customer purchasing, product sales, and revenue.

---

## Why It's Important

- Shows how to organize business data in a clean and efficient way using SQL.
- Demonstrates the ability to answer important questions like:
  - Which customers place the most orders?
  - Which products and categories are most popular?
  - How much revenue comes from delivered orders?
  - Who are the high-value customers?
- These are fundamental analytics skills for real business scenarios.

## How to Use

1. Run the SQL script (`SQL-Data-Analysis.sql`) on your SQL database server (MySQL, SQL Server, PostgreSQL, etc).
2. This will create tables, insert data, and provide ready-to-use queries.
3. Change, extend, or run queries to explore the data and practice your analysis skills.

## Key Queries Example

- Orders by Credit Card, latest first
- Total sales by product category
- Customer-product order lists
- High-value and frequent customers
- Revenue from delivered orders

## Summary

This project is a practical demonstration of using SQL for real-world data analysis tasks and showcases foundational database and analytics knowledge.
